# Capstone-Project---Relocating-in-Toronto
311 provides residents, businesses and visitors with easy access to non-emergency City services, programs and information 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 311 can offer assistance in more than 180 languages. The City of Toronto has been made aware that some of its residential areas (namely those near Downtown Toronto) may have hazardous materials buried. As a service to residents 311 is offering to identify areas for current residents that are similar to the ones that they live in currently (obviously wihout the buried hazardous material). Subsequent relocation would be free for those residents whose housing is paid for by Toronto . Other residents needing to be relocated will have thier expenses subsidised
